      <h1> WHAT are we handling?</h1>
      <p>
        The ENIGMA Machine applied encryption through a system of <strong>rotors</strong>, <strong>reflectors</strong> and <strong>plugboard</strong>. </p>

        <p>
        Each <strong>rotor </strong> has 26 positions, corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. Most models included 3 rotors arranged adjacently 
        along a spindle. Some even fancied 4 or 5 rotors, which increased the complexity. When a key
        is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle. On the sides of the rotors are a series 
        of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed 
        wiring on either end of the spindle. When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard 
        is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring. 
        Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of 
        circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display lamp, which shows the output letter

The <strong> reflector </strong> ensures the encryption is reciprocal. It reflected the electrical signal Back
through the rotos. This doubled the number of possible connections and ensured that the encryption 
was symmetrical. However, this design introduced a <strong> flaw</strong>.
No letter could ever encrypt to itself. This weakness was later exploited by Allied codebreakers.

      <p>
        The <strong> plugboard </strong> however, was the beast. It was a panel with 26 jacks (A-Z), allowing pairs of letters to be swapped before and after the signal passed through
        the rotors. The plugboard was responsible for over 60% of the machine's encryption strength and made over 100 billion possible 
        configurations. It was one of the main reasons Enigma was considered unbreakable

      This is what we aim to achieve with mechanics and code.

  <h1 class="goal-heading">WHERE are we going?</h1>
  <p class="goal-desc">
    We aim to make a version of ENIGMA that combines modern electronics.<br>
    Following are the plans:
  </p>
  <ul class="goal-list">
    <li>Use Arduino Micro-controller to enable serial communication</li>
    <li>Code a GUI, either in JavaScript or Python to send messages</li>
    <li>Use LCD display to display the encoded message</li>
    <li>Apply rotary encoder for real-time rotor adjustment</li>
    <li>Implement ProtoThreads and PIC32</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<section class="how-section">
<h1 class="how-heading"> HOW do we go about it?</h1>
<p>
  An entire software simulation of the ENIGMA machine is possible, which is the first part of our journey. It can either be through JavaScript
  or Python. The process of making a working simulation will help us understand the mechanics intricately.
  <br>
  Next step would be to think about all the hardware components that we can add to make it more interactive. As, given above, some
  would be a <strong>rotary encoder</strong> for real-time rotor adjustment, a <strong>LCD display</strong> to show the encoded message, and a <strong>plugboard</strong> to swap letters.
