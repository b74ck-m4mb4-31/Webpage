    <h1>The Evolution of Encryption</h1>
    <p>
  Humanity's fascination with secrecy dates back centuries — from Julius Caesar’s legendary cipher to the advanced encryption systems of the digital age. Over time, many devised their own ingenious methods of hiding information.
  <br><br>
  Anyone who has explored cryptography or electronics would recognize the name <strong>Enigma</strong>. This project is a tribute to that iconic machine — a marvel that once caused immense frustration for Allied cryptanalysts during World War II.
  <br><br>
  While most early ciphers relied on manual effort, one device revolutionized the field: the <strong>Enigma Machine</strong>. Developed by Nazi Germany, it employed a complex, dynamic encryption scheme using electromechanical rotors. It allowed secret messages to be encoded and decoded in ways never seen before.
  <br><br>
  Today, with powerful computational tools at our fingertips, we aim to recreate the brilliance of Enigma — not with wood and gears, but with code and creativity.
